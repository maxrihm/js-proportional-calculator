## Proportional Calculator
This is a simple calculator that helps you calculate proportional ratios and percentages. For instance, you can use it to calculate the quantity of ingredients needed for a recipe when you want to change the number of servings. You can also calculate any percentage of an original number.

### How to Use
* To calculate proportional ratios, add the name of the ingredient in the first input field and the weight in the second field. If you need to add more ingredients, simply click on a next field to add another input.
* If you want to change the number of servings, double-click on the weight field of the ingredient you want to adjust. The proportional calculator will appear at the top of the page, where you can adjust the number of servings using a slider or by entering a value. The calculator will automatically calculate the new weight of the ingredient based on the adjusted number of servings.
* To calculate percentages, enter the original number in the first field and the percentage you want to calculate in the second field.
